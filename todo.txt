1. add deepmind wrapper for osu env (frameskip/framestacking, rgb->gs?)

issues to fix:
    * add a more consistent way of determining the 'done' parameter in env.step()
    * first few digits in the scoring function have consistent mistakes
    * pyautogui literally does not move around in osu (need a different package)
