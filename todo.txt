1. add deepmind wrapper for osu env (frameskip/framestacking, rgb->gs?)
2. add standard functions for env i.e get_random_action, etc
3. make it so rewards in env.step() return incremental rewards, not the entire score at each time step

issues to fix:
    * (fixed!) add a more consistent way of determining the 'done' parameter in env.step()
    * (fixed!) first few digits in the scoring function have consistent mistakes 
    * pyautogui literally does not move around in osu (need a different package)
